The Gentleman's Game

Upon the verdant field of green they stand,
With willow blade held firm in leather hand,
The bowler charges, arm raised to the sky,
As crimson sphere goes hurtling swiftly by.

The crack of bat meets ball with perfect sound,
As fielders chase it racing o'er the ground,
The stumps stand sentinel, three wooden guards,
While scorers mark their runs on weathered cards.

From dawn to dusk the battle ebbs and flows,
Through maiden overs, boundaries, and throws,
The spinner weaves his magic in the air,
While batsmen dance their footwork with such care.

In whites they play beneath the summer sun,
Until the final wicket has been won,
For cricket is not just a game, you see—
It's poetry in motion, wild and free.

From village greens to stadiums that roar,
The spirit of the game lives evermore,
Where patience, skill, and honor intertwine,
In cricket's grand and timeless design.
