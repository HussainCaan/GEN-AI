Day-to-day tasks like browsing, social media, and video streaming run smoothly, and the battery easily lasts a full day under normal usage. In good lighting, the camera captures sharp and vibrant photos.

However, performance can slow down slightly when running heavy apps or games, and low-light camera results are average. Fast charging is supported, but the charger included in the box is not the fastest available in this price range.

Overall, the Nova X10 is a well-balanced mid-range smartphone that offers good value for everyday users, especially those who prioritize design, display, and battery life.""")
